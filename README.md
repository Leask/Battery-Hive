# Battery Hive
ðŸ”‹ A tray to arrange all your batteries.

This project was designed in Blender. And I am providing all the `.blend` files and a printable `.stl` model. Feel free to make any tweaks and remix. To print this project, you will need a 3D printer that can print up to 30.2 cm * 29.0 cm.

If you have any problem, you can find me here: https://twitter.com/LeaskH/ .

This project is `not for commercial use`.
